***Definitions:***

- The App is a console application.


***Non-Functional Requirements:***

- The App should be implemented in Python (The Implementation).

- The Implementation should include unit tests using Unittest framework (The Unittests)! If the unittests are put in the subfolder, make sure to include __init__.py to make them discoverable.

- The main executable code file of The App should be called "{{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}". The main executable code file does not have any semantic meaning and it should be completely disregarded when generating the code (except for the file name).


***Test Requirements:***

- The Conformance Tests of The App should be implemented in Python using Unittest framework. The Conformance Tests will be run using "python -m unittest discover" command. Therefore, if the unittests are put in the subfolder, make sure to include __init__.py to make them discoverable. 

- The Conformance Tests must be implemented and executed - do not use unittest.skip() or â€œany other test skipping functionality.

- The main executable code file of The App is "{{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}".

- The current working directory contains the file "{{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}".

- The App can be executed using the command "python {{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}".


# The Python console application boilerplate

***Functional Requirements:***

- Implement the entry point for The App.
