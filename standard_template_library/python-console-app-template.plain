***Definitions:***

- :App: is a console application.

- :Implementation: is the technical implementation of :App:.

- :Unittests: are the unit tests of :App: and are part of :Implementation:.


***Non-Functional Requirements:***

- :Implementation: should be in Python.

- :Implementation: should include :Unittests: using Unittest framework! If :Unittests: are put in the subfolder, make sure to include __init__.py to make them discoverable.

- The main executable code file of :App: should be called "{{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}". The main executable code file does not have any semantic meaning and it should be completely disregarded when generating the code (except for the file name).


***Test Requirements:***

- :ConformanceTests: of :App: should be implemented in Python using Unittest framework. :ConformanceTests: will be run using "python -m unittest discover" command. Therefore, if :ConformanceTests: are put in the subfolder, make sure to include __init__.py to make them discoverable. 

- :ConformanceTests: must be implemented and executed - do not use unittest.skip() or “any other test skipping functionality.

- The main executable code file of :App: is "{{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}".

- The current working directory contains the file "{{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}".

- :App: can be executed using the command "python {{ main_executable_file_name | code_variable }}".


# The Python console application boilerplate

***Functional Requirements:***

- Implement the entry point for :App:.
